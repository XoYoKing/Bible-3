# µBible

µBible is built because we saw the lack of intuitive Cebuano translated Bible available in the Google Play Store. µBible is a project done by the Youth of the Pentecostals of Mandaue City, United Pentecostal Church Philippines, Inc.

If interested you can download the µBible for Android via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.b3studios.bible).
